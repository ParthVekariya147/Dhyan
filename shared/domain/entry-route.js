/**
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHERE DOES THIS YUVAK BELONG RIGHT NOW? — asked once, answered here (§10)
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every route decision in the યુવક app used to be a condition inside whichever component
 * happened to be mounted: Login pushed '/', PublicOnly pushed '/', Guarded pushed
 * '/welcome', Register pushed '/welcome'. Four opinions, and they disagreed — signing in
 * as a યુવક who had not passed the પ્રવેશદ્વાર went login → '/' → '/welcome', two
 * navigations and a flash of the મુખપૃષ્ઠ he was not entitled to see (§15).
 *
 * So the decision is a pure function of what is known about the યુવક, it lives here, and
 * the components only render what it returns. Pure and in shared/domain/ for the same
 * reason everything else here is: it can be asserted in scripts/test-domain.mjs without a
 * browser, a Supabase project or a router, and the states below are then facts rather
 * than four components' guesses.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * What this module does NOT decide
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * * **It never decides whether a level is open.** લેવલ ૪'s gate is the published
 *   configuration's business and the server re-checks it in `level4_submit` (§37); લેવલ
 *   ૩'s threshold is `profiles.level4_unlocked`, which only a database trigger may write.
 *   Nothing here grants anything — it answers "which page should he be looking at", and
 *   every page still asks its own questions on arrival.
 * * **It never writes.** No progress is created, advanced or reset by routing (§23).
 * * **It does not know the URLs of the levels themselves.** /level/3, /level/4 and their
 *   children are reached from the મુખપૃષ્ઠ; the only routes named here are the four a
 *   યુવક can be *sent* to without having asked.

 *      him, and answering "new user" would march him back to the વિડિયો he watched in
 *      2023 (§23: routing must never reset progress).
 *
 * They are indistinguishable from `profile == null` alone, which is why the caller passes
 * `profileError` separately. When the read failed we assume the more experienced યુવક and
 * leave him where he asked to be; the pages themselves degrade gracefully on a null
 * profile, and the next successful read corrects the answer.

/**
 * The single question of §10: given everything known, which page?
 *
 * `returning` distinguishes the two doors of §4. A completely new visitor who opens the
 * application URL is shown નોંધણી — that is the first-entry experience, and asking a
 * યુવક who has never been here to find the registration link under a login form is
 * getting it exactly backwards. `returning` is set when we have positive evidence he has
 * been here before: he asked for a protected page by its URL (so he knows it exists), or
 * he asked for /login himself.
 *
 * There is no `lastRoute` any more, and its absence is the point.
 *
 * This used to be the resume of §7/§25: the last front door he stood at was recorded on the
 * device and handed back to him on his next sign-in. Two things retired it. The first is
 * simply what was asked for — signing in should land on the મુખપૃષ્ઠ, every time, and a
 * resume is by definition the thing that stops that happening. The second is what made the
 * old behaviour hard to even recognise as a feature: /welcome was a resumable route, so a
 * યુવક who had once opened the વિડિયો was returned to it at every login from then on, and
 * from the outside that is indistinguishable from the app ignoring where he asked to go.
 *
 * Two states, two answers, nothing remembered: signed out he gets a door (§4), signed in he
 * gets the મુખપૃષ્ઠ and picks for himself.
 *
 * `installed` is the second kind of evidence, and it is the stronger of the two. See the
 * note above guardRoute() — an app on the home screen was put there by somebody who had
 * already been here, so it is `returning` established by the phone rather than by the URL.

/**
 * May he see the page he asked for, and if not, where does he go instead?
 *
 * Returns `{ allow, to, state }`. `to` is meaningful only when `allow` is false, and is
 * always a route he is entitled to — so a caller can redirect to it without asking a
 * second question, and two redirects in a row are impossible by construction.
 *
 * Three rules, and nothing else is enforced here:
 *
 *   1. **No session, no protected page** (§11). Knowing a URL has never been permission.
 *      Where he is sent depends on whether he arrived at the front door or deep-linked:
 *      the root is a first visit until proven otherwise, so it opens નોંધણી; any other
 *      path was typed, bookmarked or refreshed by somebody who has been here, so it opens
 *      લોગિન. Both carry a link to the other (§19).
 *
 *      **`installed` is what proves otherwise.** An app that was launched from the home
 *      screen is not a first visit and cannot be: somebody had to open this site in a
 *      browser and choose to install it before that icon existed. The manifest's
 *      `start_url` is `/`, so every launch of the installed app asks this function about
 *      the root — and without this flag the answer was નોંધણી, every single time, for a
 *      યુવક whose account is the reason the app is on his phone at all. He was shown a
 *      registration form on open and had to find the લોગિન link underneath it daily.
 *
 *      It is passed in rather than read here because "is this window the installed app" is
 *      a display-mode query and a `navigator` flag, and this module is pure by design (see
 *      the header). src/lib/entryRoute.js exports the reader; src/App.jsx does the asking.
 *
 *      Note what this does NOT do: /register stays a route, and the sentence under the
 *      login form still links to it. A યુવક who installed the app before he had an account
 *      — which is possible, the invitation is offered on લોગિન and નોંધણી too — is one tap
 *      from the form rather than walled off from it (§1: never a dead end).
 *   2. **A યુવક who has not passed the પ્રવેશદ્વાર is held at લેવલ ૧** — the rule App.jsx
 *      has always enforced, unchanged (§7: preserve the existing business rule).
 *   3. **Everyone else sees what they asked for.** In particular a refresh on /level/4
 *      returns to /level/4 (§12), and no authenticated યુવક is ever shown નોંધણી or
 *      લોગિન again.
