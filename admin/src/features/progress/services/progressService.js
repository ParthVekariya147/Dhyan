/**
 * §38 — organisation-wide progress, read from the tables the app actually writes.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Why this file exists at all
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are two progress systems in this project and the panel used to read the wrong one.
 * `learning_state` and `learning_sessions` shipped in 0001 and hold **zero rows** in
 * production; nothing has written them for as long as the current levels have existed.
 * What levels ૧–૪ really write is `activity_attempts`, `daily_activity_progress`,
 * `level4_attempts`, `level4_activity_progress`, `progress` and `point_transactions` — and
 * those tables are full. A panel that renders an empty table over a busy database is worse
 * than a panel with no page: someone believes it.
 *
 * 0030_admin_progress_live_scenes.sql holds the read-only, admin-gated functions this module
 * calls. Nothing here queries `learning_state` or `learning_sessions`, and nothing here
 * aggregates.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Why every count is computed in Postgres and none of it in React
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Show me the યુવકો who have passed at least two કસોટીઓ, newest activity first, page 3"
 * cannot be answered by a browser without first downloading every attempt of every યુવક:
 * the filter is over a count, and a count cannot reach a LIMIT until it exists. At 500
 * યુવકો that is the whole history on every page load, over a free-tier budget that has to
 * serve 2,000 of them (§84). Counted in the database, the answer is twenty rows.
 *
 * So the search, the thresholds, the city, the મંડળ, the date window, the level, the status,
 * the sort, the page and the page size all travel to the server, and what comes back is
 * exactly what the table renders. `total_rows` rides on every row — the same figure on each
 * — because a pager needs the size of the whole filtered set and a second COUNT query could
 * disagree with the rows beside it.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The one number that CANNOT come from Postgres: the denominator
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "૮૭ of ૧૦૮" needs the second figure, and the database has never seen it. The collection is
 * `content/darshan.json` — a file — overlaid by `public.scenes`, which withholds some દ્રશ્યો
 * and adds others. Only a browser holding the manifest can resolve the membership, which is
 * why every function below takes a `liveIds` and forwards it as `p_live_scene_ids`.
 *
 * With that array the server intersects each યુવક's submitted scene ids against exactly what
 * the app shows today: "remembered" becomes a membership test rather than a count, and a
 * યુવક who ticked 108 દ્રશ્યો of which one has since been withheld reads as 107 of 108
 * because that is what he holds — not because he missed one.
 *
 * Without it the functions fall back to 0029's rule, which can only subtract the દ્રશ્યો
 * Postgres happens to know were withheld. That fallback is honest but coarse, and the
 * summary says which one it used in `contentSource`. The page treats a manifest it could not
 * read as an error, never as a denominator it can guess (§62).
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An empty result and a refusal are not the same thing
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * admin/src/lib/errors.js sets out the panel's usual rule: an RLS *read* denial returns no
 * rows rather than an error, so a page cannot tell "nobody matched" from "you may not ask".
 * These functions deliberately break that pattern — they check the permission on their first
 * line and **raise** 42501 — which is why nothing in this file inspects a permission or
 * treats emptiness as suspicious. An empty array here means nobody matched the filter, and
 * it means nothing else.
